# Showcase Website: Maison Records
## What is this project about ?

We were contacted by *Maison Records* to make their showcase website. Through this project, we implemented an interface for any user to browse through both new and second hand records sold by Maison Records. Moreover, we included a restricted interface for the administrator and registered users. From there, the administrator is able to check his inventory, add new records, track orders, see how sales fluctuate with time, and more. Registered users are able to follow their orders, check their receipts, etc.

## What did we use ?
- React.js
- Sass
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Axios
- REST APIs
- Postman
- Heroku 
- etc.
